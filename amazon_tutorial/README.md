# Amazon Tutorial Spider
In this project, I used scrapy spider to crawl about 70 pages of laptops category in Amazon (summing to 2310 items).

1. with the help of scrapy-user-agents, It assists me to scrape 'amazon.com' with no problems.
2. Handling title, price, imageLink, and hyperLink (for further use if needed) of each item found in the website.
3. Writing the items obtained to a csv file.
4. Download some of the images to the folder of 'images_data'.
